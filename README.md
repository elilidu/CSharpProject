C# Project

These are some small project I made using c# and ASP.net Framework

Project Name:

ï‚§	Car Insurance

This project is an MVC web application that simulated a car insurance website.

It takes user input on policy Information and calculates a quote based on nosiness logic.

There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
